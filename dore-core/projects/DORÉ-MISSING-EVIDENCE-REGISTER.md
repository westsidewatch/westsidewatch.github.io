# DORÉ MISSING EVIDENCE REGISTER

Status: ACTIVE / SWEEP-01 OUTPUT
Established: 2026-08-25
Primary index: `dore-core/projects/DORÉ-MASTER-WORK-REGISTER.md`

This register records claims that are plausible or partially evidenced but should not be promoted to stronger completion/quality claims without additional proof.

## ME-001 — Sensory-loop broad robustness beyond repair milestone

**Related work:** `CW-001 — Sensory-loop consolidation / D1 reconciliation milestone`

**What is already evidenced**
A real sensory signal reached `CONSOLIDATED`; deployed seed/heartbeat diagnostics show HTTP success, deduplication and schema reconciliation; Actions probing succeeded.

**What is not yet evidenced strongly enough**
- sustained operation across many signals;
- multiple heterogeneous signal/query classes;
- quantitative duplicate/drop/error rates;
- claim/retry behavior under failure;
- long-horizon persistence across schema/runtime changes;
- systematic quality evaluation of the research answer linked to a sensory signal.

**Current classification:** `UNKNOWN_NEEDS_EVIDENCE` only for these broader robustness claims, not for the already verified repair milestone.

**Smallest useful future evidence**
A bounded benchmark using a representative batch of real or fixture signals with explicit expected outcomes, plus persisted counts for claimed/consolidated/deduplicated/failed/retried and a sampled quality check of resulting brain nodes.

**Priority:** LOW until traffic, regression risk or schema evolution makes the benchmark high leverage.
