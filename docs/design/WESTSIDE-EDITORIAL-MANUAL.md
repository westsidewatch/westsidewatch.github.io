# Westside Design OS — Editorial Manual

Status: **operational chapter of the single Westside Design OS**, not a parallel visual authority.  
Audience: Church, First Look, Journal, Olive Mountain, ONE, Dawn Library, Cinema, Search, tools, and Doré Design agents.  
Source of truth: [WESTSIDE-DESIGN-OS.md](WESTSIDE-DESIGN-OS.md) → `design-system/tokens/westside.tokens.json` → `static/css/westside-design-os.css` → approved `data-ws-scope` overrides.

## 1. Authority, layers and safe integration

This manual merges design **judgment, editing and verification** into the existing OS. It is a Markdown reference, **not loaded by public pages**. Nothing in it authorizes an extra CSS entry point, a new global palette, a competing type scale, a second CI pipeline or a site-wide geometry patch.

| Layer | Existing authority | Editorial manual action |
|---|---|---|
| Normative tokens: font, color, weight, spacing, motion | `design-system/tokens/westside.tokens.json`; `design-system/scopes.json` | **Refer to**, never redefine |
| Loaded runtime | `static/css/westside-design-os.css` | Preserve existing stylesheet links/import order |
| Surface geometry and transitions | Existing owning CSS/JS files; `data-ws-scope` | Review locally; no universal overrides |
| Editorial font detail | `docs/design/WESTSIDE-EDITORIAL-TYPOGRAPHY.md` | Keep as detailed reference; defer to OS on conflict |
| Award precedents and UI Skills | Research documents in `dore-design/` | Interpret into review criteria and exercises |
| Acceptance | Existing OS, first-look, build and deployment checks + actual browser visual inspection | Do not replace visual QA with CI status |

**Integration verified 2026-10-17:** The OS runtime already defines Bodoni Moda, genuine Bodoni Moda SC, Chiron Hei HK WS, Noto Serif TC, Chinese 200/400/600 weights and responsive `--ws-type-scale-*` semantics. Hence the old typography document's `typography-sitewide.css` authority statement is **superseded** by the OS umbrella and compatibility-runtime contract. It is not grounds to migrate or change working entry points.

**Entrypoint rules.** Hugo templates load OS through `layouts/_default/baseof.html`; standalone P2 loads `/css/westside-design-os.css` followed by its own `/css/p2-living-water.css`. Other standalone HTML is guarded by `scripts/check_design_os_entrypoints.py`: the OS stylesheet and `body[data-ws-scope]` must both exist. A manual consolidation **must not touch those references, their sequence, or any HTML/CSS/JS**.

## 2. Editorial hierarchy and real reading

Typography is architecture for reading, not decorative text. Decide the reader's sequence before choosing font sizes.

1. **Identity:** ecclesial/realm name, issue or section identity; usually one visual anchor.
2. **Primary heading:** one clear top-level editorial proposition.
3. **Section headings:** lower scale/weight than the primary title unless an explicit art-directed composition justifies parity.
4. **Body/metadata:** sufficiently legible at the actual viewport; time, author, source and captions must remain discoverable.
5. **Citation/folio:** distinct semantic typography and stable positioning; never compete with the content.

Select from the OS semantic scale; surface owners may bind scope-specific roles. Do not make a new `--root` type system and do not stretch fonts. Chinese 200 is for airy, sufficiently large editorial display; not tiny administrative descriptions. Chinese anchor 600 is for short structural titles, not whole paragraphs. English Roman/Italic Bodoni and real Small Caps retain distinct semantic roles.

Composition is measured by *text length, optical alignment, baseline, measure, contrast and breathing room*. A technically right-aligned row may still have a broken time-to-event association when the two columns are visually detached. Negative space needs a function, not merely width.

## 3. Award-calibre precedent method

The award corpus is a **research evidence bank**, not a list of winners to imitate or a claim of affiliation with Awwwards, Webby, FWA, Red Dot or D&AD. The internal phrase “Red Dot-level or reject” describes a design ambition, not an official certification.

For every candidate, document:

`reference → concept → spatial/narrative mechanism → typography/hierarchy → IA/reading path → transferable primitive → constraint → failure mode → OS-scope application → experiment`.

Transfer useful mechanisms, not surface styling:

| Precedent from award corpus | Transferable editorial insight | Guardrail |
|---|---|---|
| **The Boat** | Scroll, illustration and prose can form a single authored reading sequence | Motion must follow reading, not obscure it |
| **We Choose the Moon** | Canonical chronology can itself become information architecture | Provide clear wayfinding and overview |
| **Museum of the World** | Time and semantic relationships can spatialise a large collection | Maintain legibility and access to details |
| **Bear 71** | A linear story and an explorable information system can coexist | Avoid burying core actions behind immersion |
| **Species in Pieces** | Signature interaction comes from subject-specific metaphor | Reject ornamental effect without meaning |
| **Bascule / Microdot** | Scroll or timeline can become expressive navigation | Novelty does not excuse scroll lock or exclusion |
| **KUUM / Communication through the Ages** | Subject geometry and visual invariants can drive transitions | Preserve spatial continuity and orientation |

For Westside, engraving line, paper, dawn, water and scripture chronology may define transitions. They must **not** be used to justify content invisibility, long empty scroll bands or read-blocking animation.

## 4. UI Skills routing and acceptance

Load only the skills needed for the present defect. Imported Skills are **inspiration and decision aids**, not an installed guarantee or a replacement for Westside's OS.

| Task | Capability bundle derived from Doré research | Expected artifact |
|---|---|---|
| Layout and typography | `ui.visual-hierarchy`, `ui.design-system`, `ui.taste-anti-slop` | Type-role map, grid and optical alignment measurements |
| Motion and transitions | `ui.motion-system`, `ui.motion-forensics`, `ui.performance` | Purpose/timeline/interruption/return/reduced-motion review |
| Usability and accessibility | `ui.interaction-quality`, `ui.accessibility` | Reading order, focus/keyboard, contrast and small-screen test |
| Final polish and release | `ui.critique`, `ui.visual-verification` | Severity-tagged review and before/after screenshots |
| Variant exploration | `variant` / `prototype` / pairwise Taste Memory | A/B comparison on **one meaningful axis**, including rejection reason |

This incorporates UI Skills explorations R1–R4: route the minimum capability, test motion separately from motion authoring, deliberately break at edge states, compare against the current version, and record contextual outcomes and uncertainty. Do not generate cosmetic alternatives solely to accumulate screenshots; do not compress all user tastes into one global score.

For code and motion, make the change-level critique concrete: **block / important / polish / approve**, with a reproducible defect, owning file, anticipated visual delta and evidence.

## 5. Editorial composition and motion grammar

Follow the experimental Italian editorial grammar as a **method**, not a second visual system:

- Begin with a one-sentence visual proposition and dominant reader task.
- Map composition grid, content priority, focal point, text-safe zone, cropping, paper/ink roles and deliberate blank regions.
- Keep live text in semantic HTML/CSS; image-generation prompts describe text-free artwork.
- Compare supported composition families (quiet field, overscale tension, two-scale encounter) within the same approved OS palette and fonts.
- Motion must explain state, route, hierarchy or narrative passage; prefer existing OS motion primitives and surface-owned implementation.
- Static composition must read correctly **before** motion begins and after it settles.
- Never add a new global cascade override to patch a single screen; use the owning `data-ws-scope` and stylesheet.

Review at desktop, tablet and phone widths; normal and reduced motion; initial, mid-scroll, end, interruption and return. Browser measurements and screenshots are distinct from build-status success.

## 6. Unified editorial review / promotion gate

Record one **evidence-led** review per change, using the project skill's existing directional rubric (0–2 each across **meaning, subject, composition distinction, typography, two-ink discipline, hierarchy, interaction meaning, mobile, accessibility, editability**; 20 possible). Its original exploratory threshold is **15/20** with no zero for meaning, distinction, accessibility or editability. This is a **local creative-review screen, not an official award score or a substitute for acceptance tests**. Surface-specific feasibility, reading and performance are independent release gates.

1. **Brief:** reader goal, real copy, current viewports, locked assets and immutable sections.
2. **Before:** fetch the actual current file and prior approved screenshot; record measured DOM and type metrics.
3. **Candidate:** smallest coherent scoped change, with OS-approved tokens; preserve all source content.
4. **Evidence:** before/after and desktop/mobile screenshots; accessibility, keyboard, zoom, scroll and reduced-motion behavior.
5. **Judgment:** rubric + blocking issues + any A/B winner/loser reasoning in context.
6. **Promotion:** existing OS contract and build/CI, Cloudflare preview and **actual browser visual check**. Green CI cannot override a known visual defect.
7. **Learning:** record what worked, what failed and where; keep source research linked rather than creating a second authority.

## 7. P2 Church / Sunday schedule — Italian editorial folio

The P2 split composition preserves its water engraving, rise and opening doors on the left and the warm-paper schedule on the right. **The previous requirement to keep seven gold right-aligned headings is withdrawn** by the 2026-10-17 editorial review; it must not be treated as a locked visual asset.

- **Separate, untouched church identity:** church logo, English church name and street address are outside the Sunday programme's editorial scope. Preserve their current sizes, typography, spacing, alignment and markup; do not treat them as a schedule header.\n- **Protected:** original service times, seven worship texts and their order, ministry copy, scripture, church-name artwork, left water and door mechanics, existing OS tokens and palette.
- **Reading hierarchy:** issue/date folio → one Chinese main title → ministry context → seven numbered programme rows → next-service details → scripture.
- **Italian editorial grammar:** use a three-column folio (01–07 / tabular time / left-aligned programme), restrained hairlines, editorial whitespace and optical left alignment. English Bodoni for metadata and times; Chiron Hei HK WS for Chinese heading and reading; avoid artificially stretched type.
- **Color:** ink is the programme text; the approved palette remains available for subtle accents. The old repeated gold right-aligned headline treatment is not mandatory.
- **Implementation:** owning `static/css/p2-living-water.css` only; do not create another runtime, modify OS globals, replace engraving artwork or interfere with scroll/door choreography. CSS counters supply numbers without altering source copy.
- **Proportional folio (2026-10-17):** make the schedule-owning right pane an inline-size container; use percentage-based inner gutters, container-relative column proportions and `cqi` fluid type with readable clamp bounds. Do not use CSS `transform:scale` on typography or the entire schedule. Preserve whitespace on both sides at any zoom and stack columns below the narrow-container threshold.\n- **Scripture:** the theme scripture remains left-aligned editorial reading; the independent Acts 4:12 closing citation is centered, including its reference.\n- **Acceptance:** actual 1648×928, 768px and 390px previews, 200% zoom, longest-row wrapping, keyboard and reduced-motion review, plus existing CI. A green CI alone does not certify editorial quality.

## 8. Seven-surface P2 — Magazine-anchored fixed field and native engravings (2026-10-30)

**Composition decision.** Chapter 01 LivingWaterWest is deliberately exceptional:
its living-water / Red Sea split, door and Christian-institutional reading
structure have their own accepted proportions. Beginning with Chapter 02
Magazine, the remaining six realms reuse the **exact 5:8 cover + square
Contents + original seven-color spine outer spread bounds**, measured from
the existing Magazine folio rather than recreated by another CSS percentage
or a new full-screen return animation. On mobile, the Magazine's approved
stacked geometry determines the outer proportions; a new fixed crop must
not override it. The surrounding background field is spatially continuous;
its contents, not its size, change across realms.

**The background belongs to each realm, not to a universal film loop.** The
Magazine retains its original homepage six-clip video in the already accepted
proportion. Bible, Sermon, Book, Cinema and Life may replace THAT SAME
background region with their subject-specific engraving, paper tone and ink,
using the one existing visual authority
`static/css/westside-engraving-authority.css`. Do not replay the Magazine
video in every chapter, create duplicate media players or make a full-screen
film-to-engraving transformation. The per-chapter motif must be readable
in the exposed non-content field while the actual chapter's paper/imagery
stays opaque above it.

| P2 chapter | Existing engraving owner / subject | Editorial character |
|---|---|---|
| 01 Church | `sites-section-church`: living currents / baptismal flow | **Distinct composition**; no compulsory Magazine geometry |
| 02 Magazine | `sites-section-journal` / `sites-section-vol-00`: editorial folds and page diagonals | Original video outside cover, Contents and original spine |
| 03 Bible / Emmaus | `sites-home-realm[data-realm=bible]`: canonical page/folio contours; existing manuscript scroll-edge SVG | ONE golden paper and real 241-image Doré gallery inside spread |
| 04 Sermon / Olive | `sites-section-olive`: olive terraces / hillside contours | Speaker portraits and words on opaque paper |
| 05 Book / Dawn Bookshop | `sites-section-dawn-library`: layered leaves, folios | Book material / fine plate-edge hatches |
| 06 Cinema / Paradise | `sites-section-cinema`: curtain folds and projected-light contours | Film playback owns attention; do not run two independent films |
| 07 Life / Daylight Café | `sites-section-daylight-cafe`: table rings, objects and conversation | Intimate domestic engraving, not generic line wallpaper |

**Art-direction requirement.** These CSS motifs are an existing *semantic
engraving grammar*, **not accepted award-grade artwork**. Each chapter's
authentic subject, original engraved source or approved authored SVG,
cross-hatching density, line direction, texture scale, dark/light falloff,
text-safe zone and material color must still be developed and visually
reviewed. Do not mark generic repeating CSS patterns as complete engraving
art. Chapter 03/04 are the only implemented follow-up candidates today;
05–07 are design rules rather than invented completed screens.

**Acceptance.** Preserve the frozen original seven-color Magazine spine
and original Church as read-only source layers; compare exact bounding
rectangles of Magazine, Bible and Sermon at 1648×928 and 390×844, plus
reverse scroll, 200% zoom and reduced motion. The fixed outer field and
individual inner layouts have different owners: do not force every chapter's
content into the same typography or internal grid merely because their
outer rectangle aligns. Keep all work under Design OS and the existing P2
owning CSS/JS; do not introduce a second global engraving manager.
